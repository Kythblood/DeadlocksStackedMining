[technology-description]
stacked-mining-tech=Advances in technology allow us to extract entire stacks of ores instead of single items. Mining time and yield stay the same overall.

[mod-setting-name]
kyth-overwrite-deadlock-stack-size=Overwrite of compression factor (Stack size)
kyth-high-pressure-offshore-pump=High pressure offshore pump

[mod-setting-description]
kyth-overwrite-deadlock-stack-size=Allow overwrite of the stack size selected in Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders mod of stacked ore and manually set the factor that the ore is compressed by.\n\nUseful in case some other mod makes changes to the Deadlock's Stacking stack size. This should be the same as the number of items making up each stacked item.\nIf the default "disabled" is selected, the stack size is automatically set to the value selected in the settings of Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders.\n[color=orange]WARNING: It is recommended to not change this setting or the Stack size setting in the mod settings of Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders mid game.[/color]\nDefault: disabled
kyth-high-pressure-offshore-pump=Adds a High pressure offshore pump that outputs High-pressurized water directly, but at a lower rate than a normal offshore pump.\nThe pressurized output/second is adjusted automatically depending on the fluid compression rate selected in the settings of Pressurized fluids, meaning the (uncompressed) output/second stays the same overall.\nDefault: enabled
